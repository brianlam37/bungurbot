# Bungurbot

This is a personal project made for a friend to use in our discord server. It was made to send images of rabbits from an imgur album managed by said friend.

## How it works

The bunPic command uses node-fetch to send a GET request and retrieve an image from Imgur using their API.

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The language used

### Modules

* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) - The module used to interact with Discord's API
* [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) - The module used for fetching

## Acknowledgments

* Discord.js for their guide on discord bots
* Inspired by a member of my discord server
